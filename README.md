# RanForrest: Novel metrics and visualizations for gene and cell-type prevalence across single-cell studies

## Dataset:
We used Human "Colon Ulcerative Colitis" dataset.

## Experiments
### RanForrest:
In this section, we use random forest classifier to identify the cell type that has more distinguishable cells between healthy and inflamed. Further information and details are explained in RanForrest.ipynb.


### DE heatmaps:
Download the datasets for different setups from [here](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/ov6OiLyc3V2xEo2). Put the .npz files in folder datasets/scattering/.
