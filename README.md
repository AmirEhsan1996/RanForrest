# RanForrest: Novel metrics and visualizations for gene and cell-type prevalence across single-cell studies

## Dataset:
We used Human "Colon Ulcerative Colitis" dataset.

## Experiments
### RanForrest:
In this section, we use random forest classifier to identify the cell type that has more distinguishable cells between healthy and inflamed. Further information and details are explained in RanForrest.ipynb.


### DE heatmaps:
In this section, we performed differential expression (DE) analysis using two different statitical methods (t-test and wilcoxon) on the genes of cell types we idenfied with RanForrest classifier and visuzalied DE of top 5 marker genes with heatmaps. Further information and details are explained in DE_Analysis.ipynb.
